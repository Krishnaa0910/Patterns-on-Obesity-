# Patterns-on-Obesity-
In this project, we have used multiple machine learning Algorithms to understand the underlying patterns of obesity on the patients using the health records of the patients. We have used algorithms like SVM ,XGBoost and GBM due to the presence of unbiasness in the datadet we have done Smote downsampling to balance the dataset and do the further processing in this project.
